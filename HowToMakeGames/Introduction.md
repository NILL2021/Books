# Introduction 
You might be an artist, a composer, a gamer, a programmer looking for design skills, or just someone who wants to pick up a new hobby.
I'm going to guide you through making your first few games. And you'll be ready for game jams.
# Tools
Everybody has their prefrences. You might want to just learn unity, then this is not for you. Maybe you just want to learn LÖVE2D? Stop reading when we move on from there. 
Make sure you're reading the right thing.
We'll be using:

LÖVE2D, Godot, Pygame, and maybe Delve (I'll think about that one)

Optional tools i'll be using: 

Photoshop (Free alternative: GIMP), Bosca Ceoil, Aseprite, Audacity, Atom, Visual Studio Code, Vim.

I hope you learn what you want to from this book and are confident to start making some games of your own!
